**2D Primitives Implements in Python and JS**

**Overview**

Welcome to the 2D Primitives with OpenGL project! This project demonstrates how to create and render basic 2D shapes‚Äîpoints, lines, squares, triangles, and circles‚Äîusing Python's librarys. This is for implementation about line drawing algorthm. Using Brute Force, DDA, and Bresenham. I crete this with Python and JavaScript, but over all it's python focused.

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Python 3.11 or above installed. You‚Äôll also need the following libraries:
- Pygame: For window handling and event management.
- PyOpenGL: The core library for interfacing with OpenGL.
- Matplotlib: For additional plotting functionalities.
- Tkinter: Provides basic GUI components (comes pre-installed with Python).
- Pillow (PIL): For image processing.
- OpenCV (cv2): Optional, for advanced image transformations.
Note: If you encounter issues with PyOpenGL_accelerate, it‚Äôs optional and can be skipped.

**Instalation**

Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/Romyadhy/Primtif2D-py`
  - Pygame: `pip install pygame`
  - PyOpenGL: `pip install PyOpenGL`
  - Mathplolib: `pip install matplolib`
  - Tkinter: `pip install tk`
  - Pillow: `pip install Pillow`

**Structure File**
You can see all the code in folder, and some output in folder img

You can see all those file about my code, and you can costomised those as free üòÅ
