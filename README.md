**2D Primitives Implements in Python and JS**

_Overview_

Welcome to the 2D Primitives with OpenGL project! This project demonstrates how to create and render basic 2D shapes—points, lines, squares, triangles, and circles—using Python's librarys. This is for implementation about line drawing algorthm. Using Brute Force, DDA, and Bresenham.

**Prerequisites**
  - Python 3.11 or above (this library do not has specific version of python)
  - Pygame: pip install pygame
  - PyOpenGL: pip install PyOpenGL
  - Mathplolib: pip install Matplolib


_Note: If you encounter issues with PyOpenGL_accelerate, you can proceed without it, as it's an optional optimization library._
